				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>We’re fond of saying that smart investors always know what’s going on with their investment. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we’ve gone on a mission this month to find you some of the best resources for learning more, watching and discussing cryptocurrencies. Check out some of these cryptocurrency websites, forums and message boards you should be reading regularly if you plan to invest soon – or have already taken the plunge.</span></p>
<h4><b>Cryptocurrency News and Headlines</b></h4>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/"><b>Coin Market Cap</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is the one of the most popular sites for keeping an eye on the value and market caps of the various cryptocurrencies – and it also tells you just what’s happening in the cryptocurrency world as it happens, so it’s a great website to bookmark as a resource.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/"><b>CoinDesk</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls itself the “leader in blockchain news”, and we’ve always found that its headlines are pretty darn up-to-date. Another great website to bookmark for your cryptocurrency news.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.crypto-news.net/"><b>CryptoNews</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another website that keeps readers up to date with new developments in cryptocurrency – the highs, the lows and the new currencies that are about to make a difference. Keep an eye on it, and also visit their YouTube channel for videos related to cryptocurrencies and news.</span></p>
<h4><b>Cryptocurrency Forums and Message Boards<img class="size-medium wp-image-37113 alignright" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Crypto-Websites-to-Watch-300x169.jpg" alt="Crypto Websites to Watch" width="300" height="169" /></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need to know if a cryptocurrency is legit? Or maybe you just have a few quick questions about cryptocurrency for a fellow-investor. Forums could even be the right place to hear about more cryptocurrency investment opportunities as they’re announced by other users and investors. Check out some of these cool message boards&#8230;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/"><b>Reddit</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddit has become the go-to place for internet news, and they’ve got a section for users to discuss cryptocurrencies. Many important cryptocurrency announcements have happened right here, so it’s worth checking out and searching through as a huge knowledge base.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/"><b>Bitcoin Talk</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Talk is currently one of the largest three bitcoin discussion boards on the internet, so you’ll connect with thousands of investors and users with helpful tips and stories to tell. Go here if you want to get right into the middle of the cryptocurrency world.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://mastersofcrypto.com/forum/"><b>Masters of Crypto</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masters of Crypto is a little bit of a smaller community than the others mentioned on this list, but it’s worth joining for the expertise on there – and the fact that it’s a still-evolving and developing community highly on the rise.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://forum.bitcoin.com/"><b>Bitcoin Forums </b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thought we&#8217;d follow that up with another large discussion forum for bitcoin investment, which you can find over at Bitcoin Forums. Many users are active on this one, and most are happy to share their tips or experience with newcomers – and if you find yourself unsure about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">anything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> related to cryptocurrency, this is a good place to check it out first. Just hit the search function to see prior posts.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://bitco.in/forum/"><b>Bitco.in Forums</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This website’s description notes that they welcome investors, developers and academics to the site to discuss bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related subjects – this makes it an excellent place to go if you’re into the development end of cryptocurrency, maybe even if you want to create your own.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>February is the month of love, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and we thought it would be a great idea to give cryptocurrency investors some gift ideas for their significant other. (By the way, Valentine’s day is the 14 of February – it’s the same every year, and don’t you forget it!) Here are some cool gift ideas that you can pay for in cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://btcfor.gifts/"><b>Gift Cards with Crypto</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gift Cards with Crypto is a website set up so that you can buy gift cards from popular retailers with cryptocurrency. These cover </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">most major retailers abroad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so it’s a perfect way to turn your cryptocurrency into gift cards and buy whatever your loved one desires. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoin.travel/"><b>Bitcoin Travel</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Travel is a travel agency just for bitcoin – now you can go anywhere in the world with your cryptocurrency. Hasn’t your significant other been saying that they could </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use a holiday? Make this the year you actually do it! You can also check out Fortune.com’s listing of </span><a href="http://fortune.com/2017/12/21/bitcoin-travel-cryptocurrency-bookings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bitcoin travel bookings here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://spendabit.co/go?q=jewelry"><b>Spendabit<img class="size-medium wp-image-37109 alignleft" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Crypto-Valentines-Day-300x169.jpg" alt="Crypto Valentines Day" width="300" height="169" /></b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spendabit is a catalog for things you can buy with bitcoin, and here is their section for jewellery places accepting bitcoin as a payment method. Diamonds are a girl’s best friend, aren’t they?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reeds.com/about/Bitcoin.html"><b>Reeds Jewelers</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeds Jewelers is an already-established jeweller who has started accepting payments in bitcoin. You can find their page for bitcoin investors and buyers at the link above.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cryptojeweler.com/"><b>CryptoJeweler.com</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucky for you, Reeds Jewelers isn’t your only option – there’s also CryptoJeweler.com, which allows for payments with most of the popular cryptocurrencies so you can get your partner something glittery for this year.</span></p>
<h4><b>A Hardware Bitcoin Wallet</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hardware bitcoin wallet makes a great gift – especially for couples who are investing and mining bitcoin together. The coolest option we found is the Trezor cryptocurrency wallet</span><a href="https://www.takealot.com/trezor-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallet-black/PLID48227535?gclid=CjwKCAiA78XTBRBiEiwAGv7EKin4os9IC0qMRd3JNimGC6vvfUCvDgsmg3Y0FWGahIk-fKjx79UWyhoCrbIQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available from Takealot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s up to you whether you’d like to pre-load some surprise cryptocurrency onto your spouse’s wallet as an extra, extra gift for Valentine’s day.</span></p>
<p><b>Did we mention that Valentine’s day is the 14</b><b>th</b><b> of February? Yes, this is the same every year – make sure you mark it on your calendar!</b></p>

So, if you’ve got some cryptocurrency stashed or mined, why don’t you consider turning it into assets? Here’s where you can buy cars and property in South Africa&#8230;]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><img class="size-medium wp-image-37106 alignleft" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Cryptocurrency-Property-Car-Markets-300x178.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency Property &amp; Car Markets" width="300" height="178" />Many queries ask us “what can you buy with bitcoin?”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it turns out that you can buy almost anything with cryptocurrency – including cars and property. So, if you’ve got some cryptocurrency stashed or mined, why don’t you consider turning it into </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">assets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Here’s where you can </span><b>buy cars and property in South Africa and internationally with cryptocurrency.</b></p>
<h4><b>Property</b></h4>
<p><b>For rentals, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">real estate news site Home Times debated the position of whether or not South African tenants should be able to pay for their rent in cryptocurrency. Why not, we figure, as it’s already something happening overseas. You can read the original article at </span><a href="http://hometimes.co.za/2017/09/can-south-african-tenants-pay-rent-in-bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re </span><b>looking to buy instead</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the first real estate agency in South Africa to start accepting bitcoin as a payment method for transactions is </span><a href="http://www.devler.co.za/bitcoin/"><b>Devler</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They first started accepting cryptocurrency on the 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of June, 2016. Yes, properties listed on the site are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">local</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><b>Bitcoin-Real Estate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a website that lists properties for sale and payable with bitcoin. Lucky for investors, they list properties internationally – and South African cryptocurrency investors will be happy to hear that it includes a couple South African properties too. Their listings can be found by </span><a href="http://bitcoin-realestate.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visiting their website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>BitPremier Real Estate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is similar to the above-listed Bitcoin Real-Estate, though with much less local options – so only available to investors who prefer to invest in something internationally. Their listings can be found </span><a href="https://www.bitpremier.com/5-real-estate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">through their website.</span></a></p>
<p><b>Spendabit </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a super-useful search engine for just what you can spend your bitcoins on. </span><a href="https://spendabit.co/go?q=real+estate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is their section for all search results matching “real estate” which includes both houses and empty lots.</span></p>
<h4><b>Cars</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish you could just get behind the wheel of your dream car and drive it to your new destination – or just around the block – then it could be time to take your cryptocurrency and purchase a car. Here are some practical options for investors, including those in South Africa!</span></p>
<p><b>Bitcar</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a cryptocurrency based around the ownership of a</span></p>
<p><b>Fury Ford Dealership in Amamzimtoti </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">has become the first South African car dearlership to accept payments for cars in bitcoin – either in full or as a deposit, according to their website. Take advantage of this and cash out your bitcoins for a car by visiting their </span><a href="http://www.furyfordtoti.co.za/bitcoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website’s bitcoin page.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.spendbitcoins.com/places/c/car-dealers/"><b>Spend Bitcoins</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another catalog website for where you can spend your cryptocurrency. Here is their section for car dealers.</span></p>
<p><b>Idom, the largest car dealership in Japan,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now also accepting bitcoin as a payment method – if you’re traveling or don’t mind having your vehicles shipped your way, this could still be a viable option for investors. Read the original article in Finance Magnates </span><a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/japans-largest-car-dealership-now-accepts-bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by clicking here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will you be buying with your cryptocurrency this year? If you haven’t invested or mind yet, we can help you!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common questions we get asked is “What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in?” Well, we took a look at the current top 10 trending cryptocurrencies according to market watch and cryptocurrency news site </span><b>CoinMarketCap, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">their current trading value and why you should consider investing in these </span><b>cryptocurrencies that are on the rise right now.</b></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Bitcoin</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $10, 244.80<img class="size-medium wp-image-37103 alignright" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Top-10-Trending-Cryptocurrencies-300x169.jpg" alt="Top 10 Trending Cryptocurrencies" width="300" height="169" /></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency that began the trend, and is arguably the one most people are familiar with. It was started by creator Satoshi Nakamoto, after whom the split denomination “satoshi” is named. It’s still on the rise and an excellent investment, but people shouldn’t forget that it’s not the only one around. </span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><b> Ethereum</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $1, 106.24</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum is a very strong competitor to bitcoin and one worth investing in. Its website describes it as “a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship or third-party inference.” That, folks, means it’s pretty secure – that’s why it’s still around.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> Ripple</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $1.15</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One ripple is worth just little over one US dollar right now – and we’d say that means it’s worth watching. There was a time when bitcoin, too, was young in terms of value – and then it shot right up to the rafters and climbed further, leaving a lot of people wishing they invested when the values were low.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Bitcoin Cash</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $1,511.83</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Cash is surging right up there with the high players, and it’s been in the news a lot recently – for one, an organization in the US is standing up to claim that Bitcoin Cash is to be known as the original cryptocurrency. Despite this, or maybe even because of it, this cryptocurrency is still going strong.</span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Cardano</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $0.519478</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano was apparently launched in September 2016 by Input Output Hong Kong, and CoinMarketCap has this in their top 10 list of currently traded cryptocurrencies. It’s been on the way up, and investors are convinced that it’ll only go up from here.</span></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><b> Neo</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $145.57</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neo immediately makes some people think of the Matrix, but it’s in fact Latin for “new” &#8211; not just an acronym for one. Now, it’s a cryptocurrency too. Neo has experienced what </span><a href="https://themerkle.com/neo-price-retakes-160-level-thanks-to-slow-and-steady-growth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">articles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the media have referred to as “slow and steady” growth, which for some investors are better than hard and fast.</span></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><b> Stellar</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $0.518292</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stellar calls itself “an open platform for building financial products that connect people everywhere”, and its steady rise since its creation (and the expectation that it’ll continue to rise in value) makes it part of the top 10 currently traded cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<ol start="8">
<li><b> Litecoin</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $164.70</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Litecoin is a cryptocurrency forked from Bitcoin, and it’s one that you likely will have heard of yourself. Maybe by this point you even own a few. It was first introduced in November 2017 by Charlie Lee, and it’s almost identical in structure to bitcoin.</span></p>
<ol start="9">
<li><b> EOS</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $12.05</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an article on </span><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/examining-eos-platform-cryptocurrency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptoslate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this cryptocurrency has attracted the attention of companies like J.P. Morgan Chase, Microsoft, Intel, and MasterCard – and at this point the heavy interest in this mysterious currency makes it number 9.</span></p>
<ol start="10">
<li><b> NEM</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Trading for: $0.772205</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEM is a unique cryptocurrency because the code that powers it was written entirely in Java. It was first launched in 2015, and it appears to be one of those cryptocurrencies that are experiencing the slow and steady growth which draws certain investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you invested in one (or more!) of the top 10?</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, most of the players in the cryptocurrency game will have heard of, mined or bought cryptocurrencies like </span><b>Bitcoin, Litecoin, Etherium </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">or </span><b>XRP</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the cryptocurrency revolution has brought a lot of new players to the market, and, well, some of their names are a little bit weird. Here are some of the cryptocurrencies with the weirdest names &#8211; and what they&#8217;re currently worth.<img class="size-medium wp-image-37068 alignright" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Weird-Cryptocurrencies-300x219.jpg" alt="Weird Cryptocurrencies" width="300" height="219" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pizzacoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PizzaCoin</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.002264 USD </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know the first real-life items bought with Bitcoin was </span><b>two pizzas for 10, 000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bitcoins. But what if you really, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> love pizza? Then you can try this coin named for the round, breaded, cheese-covered food we all love. From what we can tell, PizzaCoin kicked off in 2014. From a forum post advertising it: &#8220;PizzaCoin matches the genuinity and simplicity of a pizza with high tech futuristic global currency.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, guys&#8230;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ufocoin.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>UFO Coin</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.004284 USD</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the official website for UFO Coin, their mission is “to promote decentralization, improve and spread the adoption of the blockchain technology by active development and promotion.” Far more than just a new, weird-named cryptocurrency, people part of the UFO Coin are on a constant journey to improve not just the currency’s value, but the way the currency works and processes through the network so that it has a small impact on memory usage.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://dentacoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>DentaCoin</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.003742 USD</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DentaCoin sounds like the modern cryptocurrency used by the tooth fairy! And, well, it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> almost something like that. This cryptocurrency was, according to their official website, developed specifically for “the global dentistry industry through the Ethereum blockchain by using a value-based approach that brings all the market participants into co-working communities.” </span></p>
<p><a href="http://hobonickels.info/"><b>HoboNickels</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.032115 USD</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their website, HoboNickels was set up to make online transactions easy and efficient – and we’d say their exchange rate shows it works! Somehow the name doesn’t bring up images of untold riches, though we’d still say it’s a little catchy.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sexcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>SexCoin</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex sells, right? So why don’t we just start up a currency called SexCoin and get it over with? Oh, right, because someone’s already beaten us to it. Yes, SexCoin is specifically set up to pay for “adult entertainment”, and it’s currently listed on CoinMarketCap as going for 0.119315USD. That’s… That’s actually not bad.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://insanecoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>InsaneCoin </b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$0.119422 USD</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">InsaneCoin has experienced a growth of 53.04% according to CoinMarketCap, and there’s absolutely nothing funny about that! We’d like to keep an eye on this one just for interest’s sake. We kind of have to go with their pun here and say that the growth of InsaneCoin so far has been a little, well, insane&#8230;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nyancoin.info/whatis.nyan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Nyancoin</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.008035 USD</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We figured we’d end the article on a kind of cute note. Anyone remember a meme known as Nyancat? </span><a href="http://www.nyan.cat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(You can find the original here.)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now, there’s NyanCoin – apparently the first officially licensed cryptocurrency so far. Cool!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices were quoted from CoinMarketCap.com on 12 January 2018 GMT+2 and were current at the time of writing. Remember to check the </span></i><b><i>updated</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market exchange rate of the cryptocurrency first.</span></i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Fake news is everywhere these days, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and many unwitting people might have taken a fake news story seriously and clicked on “share” &#8211; or worse, used it to influence their investment advice. We’ve taken a look and rounded up some bitcoin fake news – plus tips on how to spot a fake news story. <img class="size-medium wp-image-37065 aligncenter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Spot-the-Fake-Bitcoin-News-300x225.jpg" alt="Spot the Fake Bitcoin News" width="300" height="225" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/chuck-e-cheese-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Headline: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man Sells Chuck-E Cheese Coins as Bitcoins</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might’ve heard about this one – even though South Africa doesn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Chuck E Cheese franchise – and you might’ve even shared it from the timeline of a friend abroad. But, alas, it’s not true</span><a href="https://www.snopes.com/chuck-e-cheese-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to fact-checking website Snopes.com. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, there wasn’t a scammer selling Chuck E. Cheese tokens as bitcoins, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to be careful on the internet! Apparently, the original story was published by a parody news website – go figure!</span></p>
<h4><b>Headline: Amazon Now Accepting Bitcoin!</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere around the end of 2017, a couple of news links popped up claiming that you could now pay for Amazon purchases with cryptocurrency, it turns out that it was a simple case of news that jumped the gun. </span><a href="https://www.google.co.za/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=34&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi-rYfJ4NLYAhXEPxQKHfalD7A4HhAWCDIwAw&url=https://www.ccn.com/debunked-rumor-amazon-will-accept-bitcoin-fake-news/&usg=AOvVaw2CTCS0rx5Raz5HHdAHii0Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Amazon is – as of the time of writing – not accepting bitcoins yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tell you as real news is that Amazon </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/11/01/amazon.../823546001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has bought three domain names that relate to cryptocurrency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which tells us that they just might be entering the game in the near future. Like we said, they jumped the gun just a little too soon.</span></p>
<h4><b>Headline: PNP Accepting Bitcoin </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a spin of the story above, some outlets reported that South African retailer Pick n Pay has now started accepting bitcoin payments right at the checkout points. Again, this was a case of news jumping the gun: Pick n Pay noted that they only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trialed </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bitcoin payments and it seems like only time will be able to tell us when they start accepting payments in cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/at-work/aussies-targeted-with-faketortion-email-scam/news-story/47500ce7081b20769f53672ea3e2d0f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Headline: Email Scam</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one isn’t fake news, but a new scam that might just land in your inbox. According to News.com.au, Australians had been targeted with an email from an unknown sender that claims it has a virus attached originating from an adult website – and would expose your viewing history unless you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay them in bitcoin</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  We haven’t found any reports of this scam in South Africa, but we thought we’d warn our readers about it ahead!</span></p>
<h4><b>Verifying a news story</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure if a news story is real or fake? Here’s what you can do to check it out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Look it up:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Copy and paste the headline of the news story into your search engine and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">see if the news story has been debunked anywhere, or posted as news on any other news websites.</span></i></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Verify it elsewhere:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Websites like Snopes.com and FakeNewsChecker keep an eye on the latest fake news and chain messages circulating the internet and tells you whether they are for real or should raise an eyebrow.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-37061 alignright" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/01/U5dsccm73UBu1KrdSbW2Cp2R5QFN8kn_1680x8400-300x200.png" alt="The Parody Cryptocurrency" width="300" height="200" />You might’ve spotted reports of what’s called “the parody cryptocurrency”. What on earth is it? No, it isn’t a cryptocurrency that’s set up to steal your money as some kind of cruel cosmic joke. In fact, it’s the complete opposite – and it might be worth checking into as an investment. </span><b>Here’s more about DogeCoin or “the parody cryptocurrency” and why it might be worth keeping an eye on.</b></p>
<h4><b>The Beginning of the Meme</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so if you’re not too clued up on what’s going on in the world of meme’s, you might have spotted this dog’s face surrounded by text. For starters, the dog is a Shiba Inu, and according to our sources, the meme first surfaced on the world wide web in 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find a Doge meme Generator to make your own memes </span><a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/Doge" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the story didn’t stop with the meme hitting the internet, or we wouldn’t be writing this to begin with.</span></p>
<h4><b>The Beginning of the Currency</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, more or less when the Doge meme started getting really popular, someone thought it would be a great idea to start a currency called DogeCoin. Yes, this was originally done as a joke. That someone is Australian Jackson Palmer, and since he created the cryptocurrency it spread almost as fast as the meme – and managed to spread fast and far enough to become a serious cryptocurrency almost overnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Dogecoin went nuts and broke the two million USD market cap. Completely, according to its creator, by accident. See reports on </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-42602038" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/dogecoin-market-cap-hits-2-billion-launched-joke-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investopedia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/a-parody-cryptocurrency-just-broke-2-billion-for-its-market-cap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  You can find </span><a href="http://dogecoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin’s website over here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or read more about Dogecoin at</span><a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dogecoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> KnowYourMeme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the internet’s Encyclopedia of memes – if you are ever in need of one!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-37057 alignleft" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Inside-Cryptocurrency-ATM%E2%80%99s-300x136.jpg" alt="Inside Cryptocurrency ATM’s" width="300" height="136" />The first bitcoin ATM was in Vancouver, Canada and opened on the 29</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of October 2013. If you don’t know yet, a bitcoin ATM operates like any other regular ATM, except it lets you exchange your cryptocurrencies for cash. We took a closer look at the history of cryptocurrency ATM’s and just how they work on the inside.</span></p>
<h4><b>South African Bitcoin ATM’s</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that SA has Bitcoin ATM’s already? The first was set up in Midrand (Kyalami) at the Metroman salon. Yes, there are luckily more.

<h4><b>How does it work?</b></h4>

Here’s an explanatory video of how to use the ATM once you’re in front of it thanks to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19tVcU4rZrU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge is Power on YouTube.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can also take a look at </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-a-bitcoin-atm-2017-9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How to Use a Bitcoin ATM” from Business Insider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US9135787"><b>The Bitcoin ATM Patent</b></a><b> War</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turns out that the patent for cryptocurrency ATM’s are a hot commodity: In December 2017 it came to light that DNA Dynamics Inc. was about to buy the patent for Bitcoin ATM’s. What this means is that other manufacturers basing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">off</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that patent in the US will, basically, have to pay royalties for the use thereof. Whoops…</span></p>
<h4><b>Inside Bitcoin ATM’s</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to websites like Google Patents, we can go digging in the patent archives to find out a little more about how bitcoin ATM’s work.</span></p>
<p><b>The “bitcoin kiosk” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is registered as US Patent 9135787 B1, and was filed on the 4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of April 2014. The inventors are listed as Mark Russell and John W. Russell.</span></p>
<p><b>According to the patent, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Bitcoin ATM contains “a bill validator, a bill dispenser, printer, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">code scanner, touch screen display, computer power in the form of a processor / controller and internet connection means. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also says “the stand-alone device may contain other components such as a backup power supply.” </span></p>
<p><b>Verification is offered with super safe, high-tech options and offers several levels of security for users. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the user enters their phone number registered to their Bitcoin wallet. Second, an OTP is sent to the user and entered into the ATM. Third, the user enters their personal PIN number. Fourth, the machine then reads the user’s palm vein pattern. </span></p>
<p><b>The last two verification steps</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to access your bitcoin involves the user posing for a photo and scanning their passport. You can read the entire patent over here on </span><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US9135787"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Patents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
